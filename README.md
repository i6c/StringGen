# StringGen

## About StringGen

Hello! StringGen is a very small personal project of mine, designed to generate a specifically chosen number of random words that can be used for a variety of purposes, although pneumonic password generation is the main purpose in mind! StringGen is actually my FIRST ever project with long(ish) term development in mind. What I mean by this is rather than just writing a simple practice program, making sure it works, and forgetting about it, I wanted to come up with a project that I could continue to improve upon that is based around more complex programming paradigms and OOP methods, that would also serve as a learning experience for me as a novice programmer\aspiring software engineer!

I decided to start this project primarily to help improve my Python skills, as well as general skills revolving around using GitHub _(which I still have difficulty with)_, and what it takes to design a usable program for others to use. StringGen may not be the most original or ambitious project out there, but for me, this is the perfect learning experience and a way to bolster my abilities.

If you have any ideas, comments, criticism, or any questions\anything else, feel free to contact me at apn1296@gmail.com or leave a comment\start a new branch and join me in learning if you are a relatively new student to Computer Science or Python\Programming in general!

Thank you so much for reading! Sincerely,

## Instructions

StringGen is very simple to use. As of now, I run StringGen through a batch file shortcut on my desktop, which runs _StringGen.py_ through the windows cmd line. Instructions will appear on screen for each step when running the program, and all user interaction is done through typing out the available options presented and then pressing __ENTER__ to run your command. I will be developing a GUI for _StringGen_ ASAP, so this will soon be unnecessary.

In order to run StringGen from your desktop, simply right click on the _StringGen.bat_ file and select _edit_. Then, simply replace the file path after "_@py_" with your own file path that leads to wherever you have the _StringGen.py_ file located on your computer. Then __SAVE__ and close the .bat file. Now whenever you wish to run _StringGen_, just make a shortcut to the _.bat_ file on your desktop, and use said shortcut.
