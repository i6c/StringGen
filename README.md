## Instructions

## About StringGen

Hello! StringGen is a very small personal project of mine, designed to generate a specifically chosen number of random words that can be used for a variety of purposes. StringGen is actually my _FIRST_ ever personal-project uploaded on Github, and with an actual _long-term "program lifecycle"_ in mind. By this I mean rather than writing a simple practice program, making sure it works, and forgetting about it, I wanted to come up with a project that I could continue to improve upon over time, simultaneously serving as a sort of beginner's learning experience for me.

I decided to start this project primarily to help improve my Python skills, as well as general skills revolving around using GitHub _(which I still have difficulty with)_, and what it takes to design a usable program for others to use. StringGen may not be the most original or ambitious project out there, but for me, this is the perfect learning experience and a way to bolster my abilities.

Thank you so much for reading, and feel free to submit and bugs/feedback you may have!
